abstract = "A mathematical model for studying the passive kinematics of total knee prostheses can be useful in computer-aided planning and guidance of total joint replacement. If the insertion location and neutral length of knee ligaments is known, the passive kinematics of the knee can be calculated by minimizing the strain energy stored in the ligaments at any angular configuration of the knee. Insertions may be found intraoperatively, or may come from preoperative 3D medical images. The model considered here takes into consideration the geometry of the prosthesis and patient-specific information. This model can be used to study the kinematics of the knee joint of a patient after total joint replacement. The model may be useful in preoperative planning, computer-aided intraoperative guidance, and the design of new prosthetic joints."
