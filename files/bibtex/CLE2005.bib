abstract="A passive forward kinematics knee model was used to predict knee motion of a total joint replacement. Given a joint angle, maps of articular surfaces, and patient-specific ligament properties, this model predicted femorotibial contact locations based on the principle of ligament-strain minimization. The model was validated by physical experiments on a commonly implanted knee prosthesis, showing excellent correspondence between the model and actual physical motion. Results suggest that the knee prosthesis studied required an intact posterior cruciate ligament to induce the desirable roll-back motion, and that a single-bundle model of major knee ligaments generated kinematics similar to that of a multi-bundle ligament model. Implications are that a passive model may predict knee kinematics of a given patient, so it may be possible to optimize the implantation of a prosthesis intraoperatively.",
