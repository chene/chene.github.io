abstract = "Due to its real-time, safe, and two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities, ultrasound has been incorporated as an imaging modality into various surgical and nonsurgical procedures. In this chapter, we provide an overview of several image-guided therapeutic applications of US, for which at least some successful preliminary preclinical and clinical translations have been demonstrated. Several examples in the areas of cardiology and orthopedics are described. We also outline various technological advancements made in order to enhance the clinical coverage and capabilities of this imaging modality. We summarize the chapter by outlining some of the remaining engineering challenges that need to be overcome in order to enhance the widespread use of ultrasound imaging as an interventional guidance and monitoring tool."
