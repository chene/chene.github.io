The course covers fundamental image processing operations that are needed for more advanced study. The operations selected are those commonly used in industry (e.g., quality control) and in research (e.g., medical imaging) and include such operations as computing histograms, contrast enhancement, algebraic operations for noise reduction and background removal, linear filtering and segmentation using techniques such as thresholding. My teaching philosophy is to motivate each topic via a practical example and then build the mathematical framework so you can implement the operation or use the most appropriate MATLAB function intelligently. The course is not about learning off-the-shelf software like Photoshop.

Lectures
======
* Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 9:30am to 10:30am
* All lectures in Spencer Engineering Building, Rm. 3109
* Start date: Thursday, September 10, 2015

Final Exam
======
Sunday December 13, 2015, 2pm-5pm, NCB 114

Site Usage
======
I will bring "skeleton" PowerPoint slides to present at lectures. These skeleton slides are not complete, and I will fill them in during class to show my logic, emphasize material and to keep a reasonably paced lecture. I will post these skeleton lectures ahead of class so you can print them and fill them in when you are in class. These skeleton slides will be posted on the left hand side under "Lectures". As I continuously fill in these skeleton slides during each class, I will re-post them under "Lectures" at the end of each class.

Solutions to all quizzes will also be posted on the left hand side under the category "Quizzes" after all students have taken the particular quiz in question.

Expectations
======
Here is what I expect of every student:
* Honesty: As I will mention in class, you will work on assignments and projects (for graduate students) in groups, but each group should do its own work.
* Attend all classes: I'd like to get to know you, and besides, there is no really good book that covers all of the material, so my lectures are important. The textbook only covers some of the material.
* Participation: It's good to ask questions in class and share ideas. It gets you known and can stimulate good discussion.
* Be timely: Submit all assignments on time. This is good professional practice. Besides, I give a lot of time for assignments.
* Keep up: Review lectures and do homeworks (not collected but answers are posted). Read e-mails from me since this is the easiest way for me to communicate with you outside of class.

This may seem like a lot, but these are fairly basic requirements of all courses. I just like to spell them out. The reward for following the above is your own professional development and my continued respect.

Here is what you can expect from me:
* Effort: I put a lot of effort in developing explanations and assignments. My aim is to motivate you, get you ready for lifelong learning and teach you tools that are important in industry and research.
* Punctuality: I am never late for lectures. I always arrive early unless something goes drastically wrong that is beyond my control.
* Availability: I respect posted office hours. I also try to be flexible to accommodate your schedule. I can`t always be available since I teach other courses and have deadlines like you, but I always try my best.
* Fairness: I never take off marks unless justified.
* Cheerleading: Not trying to sound funny, but I am cheering for your success.
