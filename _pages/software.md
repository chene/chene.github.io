## Procrustes Analysis
Procrustes Analysis refers to the registration between two dataset via a transformation, where elements between datasets have known correspondence. In the context of computer-assisted surgery, Procrustes Analysis menifests as point-to-point, point-to-line, and point-to-surface registration.
