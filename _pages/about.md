Elvis C.S. Chen received his PhD from School of Computing, Queen's University, Canada (2007) with a focus on joint kinematics modelling. After two years of post-doctoral fellowship, he jointed Robarts Research Institute in 2009 where he is now a Scientist. He holds cross-affiliation with Biomedical Engineering and the Department of Medical Biophysics, Western University (Canada).

Dr. Chen's AI-Assisted Interventional Laboratory ( (AI)^2 Lab ) is concerned with the development and validation for AI-enabled tools and workflow that allow surgeons to make efficient use of medical images, produced by sophisticated 3D imaging systems, during image-guided surgical interventions.
He is currently serving as an Associator Editor for IEEE Transaction on Medical Imaging ([IEEE-TMI](https://www.embs.org/tmi/editorial-board/)) since 2017. He serves on the Program Committees of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE) Medical Imaging, the International conference on Information Processing in Computer Assisted Interventions (IPCAI), and the International Workshop on Augmented Environment for Computer-Assisted Interventions (AE-CAI). In Particular, he has served as the Program Chair for IPCAI 2019 in Rennes, France.
