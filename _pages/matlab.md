Here are some Matlab codes that solve very specific problems.

### [Procrustes Analysis](/software/Procrustes_Analysis)
Procrustes analysis deals with registration between points-to-points, points-to-lines, and points-to-planes.

### [Pivot Calibration](/software/Pivot_Calibration)
The location of the digitizing stylus is often determined through a process known as pivot calibration. Pivot calibration also manifests itself in other applications of computer-assisted surgery such as determining the centroid of femoral head. Several solutions exists.
