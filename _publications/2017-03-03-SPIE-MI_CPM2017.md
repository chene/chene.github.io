Based on the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) framework, we present a generalized solution for the registration between homologous points and lines. The transformation we seek comprises an anisotropic scaling, followed by rotation and translation. This algorithm is demonstrated using the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem where lines form a bundle, and the Non-Perspective-n-Point (NPnP) problem where each line potentially has its own origin. We also prove that one existing NPnP solution is, in fact, equivalent to ICP, and that a second PnP solution differs from ICP only in the iteratively estimated translation. Applications for these types of registration include ultrasound calibration, kinematics tracking under fluoroscopic video, and camera pose estimation. Simulation results suggest this ICP algorithm compares favorably to existing PnP and NPnP algorithms, and has an extremely compact formulation.
