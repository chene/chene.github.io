Purpose: To evaluate a materials model for laparoscopic guided cryotherapy or radiofrequency tissue ablation (RFA) of kidney tumors through expert surgeon assessment.

Materials and Methods: During the inaugural American Urological Association 2010 Tissue Ablative course content, validity testing of a renal tumor model was undertaken. Five expert faculty in cryotherapy and RFA techniques for renal tumors performed laparoscopic ultrasonography (US) examination of the tumor model. They performed US guided placement and activation of the treatment probe into the tumor of the model. They completed a questionnaire and rated the quality of the renal tumor model on a 5 point Likert scale.

Results: All of the subjects assigned a score of 5 of 5 on the Likert scale regarding the ability to identify the tumor with US, were able to deploy the ablative probe into the model under US guidance, and would recommend the use of this teaching model to residents or fellows. They thought that this tumor model was appropriate for teaching laparoscopic US imaging of a renal tumor during ablative treatment procedures, teaching and practicing laparoscopic US-guided cryotherapy, and teaching and practicing laparoscopic US-guided RFA.
