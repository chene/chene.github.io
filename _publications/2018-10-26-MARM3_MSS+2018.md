In computer-assisted surgery, the term “registration” typically refers to aligning preoperative patient-specific models with intraoperatively acquired data. It can be used to augment the surgeon’s view by visualizing the structures below the tissue surface. This chapter provides a short overview of the principles behind intraoperative registration, reviews the related literature on error estimation, and presents representative registration methods developed in the context of minimally-invasive surgery (MIS).
