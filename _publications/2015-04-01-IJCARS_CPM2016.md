Many image-guided interventions rely on tracked ultrasound where the transducer is augmented with a tracking device. The relationship between the ultrasound image coordinate system and the tracking sensor must be determined accurately via probe calibration. We introduce a novel calibration framework guided by the prediction of target registration error (TRE): Between successive measurements of the calibration phantom, our framework guides the user in choosing the pose of the calibration phantom by optimizing TRE.
