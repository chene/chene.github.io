Several medical imaging modalities exhibit inherent scaling among the acquired data: The scale in an ultrasound image varies with the speed of sound and the scale of the range data used to reconstruct organ surfaces is subject to the scanner distance. In the context of surface-based registration, these scaling factors are often assumed to be isotropic, or as a known prior. Accounting for such anisotropies in scale can potentially dramatically improve registration and calibrations procedures that are essential for robust image-guided interventions.
