We present a simple method for computing uncertainty in an optical tracking system. Our significant contribution is that the covariance estimates produced by our tracking algorithm are shown to closely match lower bounds established by Ohta and Kanatani. Our work addresses the existence of uncertainty in tracking and is a step toward a complete estimate of intra-operative uncertainty in computer-assisted surgery.
