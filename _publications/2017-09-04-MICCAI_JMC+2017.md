In the context of laparoscopic interventions involving intracorporeal ultrasound, we present a method to visualize hidden targets in 3D. As the surgeon scans the organ surface, we stitch tracked 2D ultrasound images into a 3D volume in real-time. This volume, registered in space with the surface view provided by the laparoscope, is visualized through a transparent window in the surface image. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by conducting a psychophysical study with phantoms, involving experienced ultrasound users and laparoscopic surgeons. The results reveal that the proposed method demands significantly less cognitive and physical effort compared to the 2D ultrasound visualization method conventionally used in the operating room.
