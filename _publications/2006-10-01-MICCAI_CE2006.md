A motion-based Inverse Kinematics Knee (IKK) model was developed for Total Knee Replacement (TKR) joints. By tracking a sequence of passive knee motion, the IKK model estimated ligament properties such as insertion locations. The formulation of the IKK model embedded a Forward Kinematics Knee (FKK) [1] model in a numerical optimization algorithm known as the Unscented Kalman Filter [2]. Simulation results performed on a semi-constrained TKR design suggested that ligament insertions could be accurately estimated in the medial-lateral (ML) and the proximal-distal (PD) directions, but less reliably in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction for the tibial component. However, the forward kinematics produced by both the true and estimated ligament properties were nearly identical, suggesting that the IKK model recovered a kinematically equivalent set of ligament properties. These results imply that it may not be necessary to use a patient-specific CT or MRI scan to locate ligaments, which considerably widens potential applications of kinematic-based total knee replacement.
